title: Adding a system to a domain
---
First create a computer account in the AD (from Active Directory Computers and Users tool.)
Then go to the machine which you want to join in the AD domain.
First- make sure that AD is reachable. For that make suer that you have one DNS entry in IPv4 properties section pointing to AD.
Then Go to Systems. Change Computer Name. And provide the domain. Enter the domain. Click OK. It shall prompt you the AD machine's admin user
who has the permission to add machines to domain.
