Active Directory Domain Service: (full ref here: https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh831484.aspx ) - must read to understand forest too
AD DS provides a distributed database that stores and manages information about network resources and application-specific data from directory-enabled applications.

A server that is running AD DS is called a domain controller.

AD DS
  * organize elements of a network
  * into a hierarchical containment structure
    # Active Directory forest, domains in the forest, and organizational units (OUs) in each domain
  * provide identity, authentication and trust identity ntework wide
  * provided logon authentication and access control

Setting up Exchange Server 2013
###############################################################

First step is to setup AD DC. Used server 2012 r2
I used this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WyBxwJD_c0
Here I only installed AD and DHCP and DNS. 
And while Configuring DHCP, I gave DNS server details that are applicable for vCloud VMs.

Then I created another server 2012 r2 to install xchange.
Before that I needed to have this new instance of r2 in domain that I created above for that, I used this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amzSIpx9fvA

While adding machine to domain, I got AD not accessible error. To resolved that, I changed the IPv4 DNS settings on this new r2 to point to machine 
where AD is running. This soulution shall work too probably: http://www.itexperience.net/2014/06/06/an-active-directory-domain-controller-ad-dc-for-the-domain-x-x-com-could-not-be-contacted-windows-azure/

Finally, I logged into this new r2 as a domain user and simply right click on SetUp.exe -> Run as administrator. Done.

Remote Desktop COnnection problem after adding the machine to domain.
###############################################################

remote desktop this computer can't connect to the remote computer

What I did was: I added the user into the remote desktop group on the AD
as well as on the computer, I went ahead and serached for setting in R2 server Select Users who can Remote Desktop into machine.

There I went ahaed and added the domain user.
